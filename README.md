# Java Programming Project

This repository contains a collection of Java programs, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. These programs were developed as part of a self-learning journey, utilizing resources from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and custom implementations. The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive set of Java examples for learning and reference.

## **ðŸ“š Introduction**
This project contains Java code snippets, programs, and utilities covering core Java concepts. The code was written to help beginners and intermediate learners understand how Java works by providing real-life examples and simple implementations.

The repository includes programs on:
- Basic syntax and control structures
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Exception handling
- Data structures (arrays, lists, maps)
- File input/output operations
- Miscellaneous utilities

## **ðŸ“Š Features**
- **Basic Java Programs:** Examples of loops, conditional statements, and basic input/output.
- **OOP Concepts:** Demonstrates classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Exception Handling:** Programs showing try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and error handling techniques.
- **File Handling:** Examples of reading and writing files in Java.
- **Data Structures:** Implementation of arrays, ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedList, and their operations.
- **Custom Utilities:** Helper methods for common operations like sorting, searching, and string manipulations.

## **ðŸ’» Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Version:** Java SE 8 and above
- **IDE:** (Replace with your IDE, e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans)
- **Version Control:** Git

## **ðŸ”§ Setup and Usage**

- Loops (for, while, do-while)

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class and Object creation
- Constructors
- Inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical)
- Polymorphism (method overloading and overriding)
- Abstract classes and interfaces

### 3. Exception Handling
- Try-catch-finally blocks
- Custom exceptions
- Nested try statements

### 4. File Handling
- Reading files using `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`
- Writing files using `FileWriter` and `BufferedWriter`
- File operations (create, delete, rename)

### 5. Data Structures
- Arrays and multidimensional arrays
- ArrayList, LinkedList
- HashMap, TreeMap
- Queue and Stack implementations

### 6. Miscellaneous Utilities
- String manipulations (reversal, palindrome check)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort)
- Searching algorithms (linear search, binary search)
